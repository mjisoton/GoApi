# GoApi

Just some REST API to try and learn Golang. The ideia is to put together a relational database, a nosql database, logging features and make the most performatic possible REST API.

## TODO:
  - Add a relational database connection
  - Add a nosql database connection
  - Add logging capabilities
  - Add a HTTP server and router

Work in progress.
