# GoApi

Just some REST API to try and learn Golang. The idea is to put together a relational database, a NoSQL database, logging features and make the most performatic possible REST API.

## TODO:
- Keep extending the Redis package until it has all the features needed and it's easy enough to use it
- Do some Rate Limiting
- DO some routing
- Middleware Auth


Still work in progress.
